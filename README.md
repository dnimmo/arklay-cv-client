Request: If you're looking at this and thinking "ooh I don't like his formatting" - I'd ask you to remember that this is an application I built for fun by myself. I realise it's normal to have a knee-jerk response to any code formatting that isn't what you're used to, but for things I'm working on entirely alone, I prefer to go with formatting that I like. As part of a team, I prefer to have formatting standards enforced, preferably without any customisation options (to minimise wasted time talking about preferences).
